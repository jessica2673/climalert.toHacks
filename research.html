      Environmental Science and Pollution Research (ESPR) serves the international community in all areas of Environmental Science and related subjects with emphasis on chemical compounds. It reports from a broad interdisciplinary outlook. Apart from the strictly scientific contributions as research articles (short and full papers) and reviews, ESPR publishes: news & views from research and technology, legislation and regulation, hardware and software, education, literature, institutions, organizations, conferences.

      Editorial Policy
For maximum benefit to the environmental community, the journal has the following features:

ESPR represents the international perspective, with emphasis on the natural sciences but also includes the impacts of legislation, regulation, and the economy on pollution control; and
ESPR articles are generally chemically oriented but cover all the broad areas within environmental science.
ESPR was conceived as a truly international scientific journal.
<br><br>
Information from ESPR should also be useful for planning lectures and university environmental curricula. A global network of editorial board members represents a variety of disciplines and groups of interest: university, industry, administrative bodies, government, consulting companies, public interest groups. The Editorial Board safeguards the international and interdisciplinary character of the journal and ensures appropriate refereeing procedures (peer review).

      <h2>Reports</h2>
      <p>
        Environmental reporting is primarily concerned with reporting an organisation’s environmental performance and is the focus of this topic. Sustainability reporting incorporates environmental performance reporting but also covers much broader aspects of an organisation’s activities, including social, economic and governance performance.

        The requirements and contents of an environmental report are explained in this topic including how to report environmental management system performances, as well as the requirements for mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases and other impacts contained in the Companies Act and related regulations. Also included in this topic are details for EMAS registration, which requires detailed information on specific performance indicators. The environment report, which EMAS refers to as an Environmental Statement, must also be independently verified and made publicly available.
        <br><br>
        Given the threats associated with climate change, greater importance is also being placed on reporting carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.
