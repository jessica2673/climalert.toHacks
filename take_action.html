  	<h>What can I do?</h>


  	<p>A good way to help the environment is to be educated! The more you know, the more you can help! Learning more is also a good way to understand what to tell others. When people don't get their facts right, the wrong information can spread like a wildfire! Make sure you understand the underlying problems of the environment so that you can help others too.</p>



  	<p>Another way you can help is to join an environment club. It is a good idea to meet other people who also care about the environment so that you can share ideas. It is also a good way to stay motivated, and having other people with you will make it more fun! Together, you can advocate for a change, such as banning plastic straws. Find an environmental issue that you want to solve, and try getting more people involved. </p>



  	<p>One more way to help is to volunteer! You can volunteer at existing organizations that help the environment to promote an existing solution. Organizations such as Me to We are already very helpful and influential. You can join these organizations to make a big difference!</p>
